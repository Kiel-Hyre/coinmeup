### About
- Testing classifiers and regressors in a cryptomarket dataset

### Installation
- Jupyter [https://jupyter.org/install]
- virtualenv [https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/]

### Setup
- create a virtual environment
- install the packages via pip install -r requirements.txt
- run jupyter via terminal
```
jupyter-lab
```
- open coinmeup.ipynb
- open coinmeup_regressor.ipynb

### Todo
- regression seems to predict 2021 with 80-90 accuracy linearRegression
- but it is useful? because you need to feed the data to predict MP
- why not predict an MP with uknown datasets e.g for 30 days
- and test the real dataset there.
- NN?
